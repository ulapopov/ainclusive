1. Hedgehogs have spines, not sharp like porcupine quills, and they don't fall off easily. 
2. Baby hedgehogs go through quilling, where old spines fall out and new ones grow. 
3. If a hedgehog is very sick or scared, it might lose some spines. 
4. Hedgehogs are mostly brown with light spines. Some special light-colored hedgehogs live on Alderney.
