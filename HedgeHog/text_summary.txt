Hedgehogs have spines, not sharp like porcupine quills, and they don't fall off easily. Baby hedgehogs go through quilling, where old spines fall out and new ones grow. If a hedgehog is very sick or scared, it might lose some spines. Hedgehogs are mostly brown with light spines. Some special light-colored hedgehogs live on Alderney.
