1. Where They Came From: Long ago, people called Eskimos moved from Asia to a very cold place called the Arctic. They like to be called Inuit, which means "people."
2. How They Live: The Inuit moved around the snow to hunt animals like seals and polar bears. They made clothes from the fur and built homes from snow called igloos to stay warm.
3. Life Today: Now, many Inuit live in towns but still keep their old ways of hunting and speaking their special language, Inuktitut.
4. Their Own Land: In 1999, the Inuit got a big piece of land called Nunavut, which means "Our Land." This lets them take care of their land and use it wisely.
