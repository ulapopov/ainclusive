A long time ago, people called Eskimos came from Asia to a very cold place called the Arctic. They like to be called Inuit, which means "people". The Inuit moved around a lot in the snow, hunting animals like seals and polar bears to get food and make clothes from their fur.

They built homes from snow called igloos when it was really cold. Today, most Inuit live in small towns and remember their old ways of hunting and speaking their special language, Inuktitut.

In 1999, they got a big piece of land to take care of, called Nunavut, which means "Our Land". This was a happy moment for them because they could take care of their land and use it wisely.
