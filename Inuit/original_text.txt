The Eskimos, originally from Asia, settled in the Arctic region around 4,000 years ago. They were named "Eskimos" by a North-American Indian tribe, a term meaning "people who eat raw meat". However, they refer to themselves as Inuit, meaning "people". The Inuits were nomadic, traversing large Arctic areas to hunt caribou, seals, fish, and polar bears. They utilized snow and earth for shelter during winter, with driftwood and turf roofs to avoid freezing. Traditional clothing came from nature, using polar bear skin or caribou fur. While they still hunt and fish, some travel up to 5,000 kilometers yearly for resources. They occasionally build igloos as temporary shelters and hunt seals by making holes in the ice.

Most Inuit now live in villages or towns, maintaining pride in their hunting traditions, culture, folk songs, and language. Inuktitut, their language, is concise, often encapsulating whole sentences in single words. In 1999, the Inuit achieved self-determination and land rights, receiving 20% of Canadaâ€™s total area, which solidified their control over natural resources and income from them. Nunavut, meaning "Our Land", was established as a territory with its capital at Iqaluit, highlighting a significant step towards autonomy and recognition for the Inuit.
